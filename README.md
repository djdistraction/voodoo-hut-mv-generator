# 🎬 VoodooHut Music Video Generator

An AI-powered pipeline that turns a song upload into a full-length animated music video — complete with ken burns motion, lyric overlays, crossfades, and particle effects — with visual continuity maintained throughout.

Built for **TheVoodooHut.tv** · Runs **100% free locally** · Upgrade path to GPU/cloud via env vars only.

## The Pipeline

```
Song Upload
↓
① Audio Analysis    — Whisper (local, free) → transcript + word timestamps
                      Groq / Llama 3.3 70B  → mood, structure, narrative arc
↓
② Visual Treatment  — Groq generates a full creative direction proposal
↓ [Human Approval]
③ Element Extraction — AI creates the registry: characters, locations, props, states
↓
④ Background Gen    — FLUX.1-schnell (HuggingFace free tier) → 1920×1080 backgrounds
↓
⑤ Element Gen       — FLUX.1-schnell → elements on transparent bg (rembg removes bg)
↓
⑥ Storyboard Build  — Pillow composites elements onto backgrounds; panels reviewed
↓ [Human Review]
⑦ Remotion Assembly — React/Remotion renders the full video in one pass:
                       • Ken Burns motion (zoom-in/out, pan-left/right)
                       • Crossfades between panels
                       • Whisper-synced lyric overlays
                       • Energy-level-driven particle effects
                       • Audio track sync
```

## Continuity Bible

Every project generates a `BIBLE.md` tracking all named elements, approved appearances, asset paths, storyboard order, and color palette — ensuring visual consistency across sessions.
